A Javascript c2 client implant implented using PM2 and deployed by Ansible.

Status: in progress

TODO:
* very WIP
* Create server - at minimum, this is just a collection of premade commands/POSTs to send and receive commands. At maximum, this is a board that shows current c2 uptime on all systems
* website spinoff? useful for access to individual systems, but won't be very relevant for automation across multiple teams at once
* current version is very visible - this is nice to give teams a low hanging fruit for implants but I need an additional version
